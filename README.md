## Envrionment Setup (Conda)
```bash
conda create -n csi_4107_assignments python=3.12
conda activate csi_4107_assignments
pip install beir tensorflow nltk
```

After your environment is created and the necessary libraries are installed, run `setup_nltk.py` to download the NLTK stopwords resource. This only has to be done once.
